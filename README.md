# Arcade.dev Exploration and Playground

This is top-level of the mono-repo containing a couple of projects, serving different purpose each.

 * `problem` — contains the [original PDF with the problem statement](problem/problem-statement.pdf)
 * `client_js_setstars` — a standalone tool, which serves as an example of using Arcade.dev's Toolkit (`Github`) and within it a single tool `Github.SetRepoStars`.
 * `client_py_getrepo` - a simple python client that similarly authenticates against YOUR Github account, and then prints information about a specific repo `kigster/githuh` — which is a simple ruby gem repo that has tests, but no CI/CD setup with Github Actions.
 * `toolkit` - the custom toolkit that's been scaffolded using the `arcade new` command
 * `app` - the app that utilizes the toolkit to perform something interesting.
