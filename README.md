# Arcade.dev Exploration and Playground

This is top-level of the mono-repo containing a couple of projects, serving different purpose each.

 * [`problem`](problem/) — contains the [original PDF with the problem statement](problem/problem-statement.pdf)
 * [`client_js_setstars`](client_js_setstars/) — a standalone tool, which serves as an example of using Arcade.dev's Toolkit (`Github`) and within it a single tool `Github.SetRepoStars`.
 * [`client_py_getrepo`](client_py_getrepo/) - a simple python client that similarly authenticates against YOUR Github account, and then prints information about a specific repo `kigster/githuh` — which is a simple ruby gem repo that has tests, but no CI/CD setup with Github Actions.

## To Be Built

 * `<some>-toolkit` - the custom toolkit that's been scaffolded using the `arcade new` command
 * `<some>-app` - the app that utilizes the toolkit to perform something interesting.
