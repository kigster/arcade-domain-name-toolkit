# Simple Toolkit Ideas for Arcade.dev

These are intentionally simple ideas that require creating just **one custom toolkit** and using **1-2 existing Arcade toolkits** to create something useful.

## What Does a Custom Toolkit Need to Do?

A toolkit in Arcade is essentially a **wrapper around an external API** that:

1. **Inherits from Arcade's base toolkit class**
2. **Defines tool methods** that call external APIs
3. **Handles authentication** (API keys, OAuth, etc.)
4. **Returns structured data** in a consistent format
5. **Handles errors gracefully** with proper error messages
6. **Includes tool metadata** (descriptions, parameters, etc.)

**Example toolkit structure:**
```python
from arcade_ai.sdk import ToolKit

class WeatherToolkit(ToolKit):
    def get_current_weather(self, city: str) -> dict:
        # Call weather API
        # Return structured weather data
        pass
```

## Recommendation: Start with Weather Alert System

**Why this is the best starting choice:**

1. **Simplest to implement** - OpenWeatherMap API is well-documented and reliable
2. **Universal value** - Everyone cares about weather
3. **Clear success criteria** - Easy to test (just wait for bad weather!)
4. **Single external dependency** - Only needs OpenWeatherMap API
5. **Reliable data source** - Weather APIs are stable and free

**Implementation plan:**
1. Create `WeatherToolkit` with 2-3 simple methods
2. Use existing Gmail toolkit for notifications
3. Create a simple app that checks weather every few hours
4. Test by setting up alerts for rain, snow, or temperature extremes

**Estimated time:** 1-2 days for a working prototype

## What Makes These Ideas Better

Unlike the previous complex ideas that tried to integrate 4-5 services, these ideas are:

- **Single-purpose** - Each solves one specific problem
- **Easy to test** - Clear success/failure criteria
- **Low complexity** - Maximum 2 external integrations
- **Real value** - Solve actual daily problems
- **Quick wins** - Can be built and deployed in days, not weeks

The key insight is that **simple tools that do one thing well** are often more valuable than complex systems that try to do everything.
